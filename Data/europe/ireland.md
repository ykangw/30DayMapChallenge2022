### University College Dublin (UCD)

Dublin, Ireland

Unit: [Department of Geography](https://www.ucd.ie/geography/)

The Department of Geography at the National University of Dublin has a long history and is strong in human geography, geopolitics, and environmental assessment. The Department of GIS is mainly a 1-year taught program, and you can apply after you graduate with a bachelor's degree, and the courses are mostly combined with natural/human geography GIS. At the same time, the department also has a 2-year research-based master's degree, which requires a proposal and can be applied for a 3-year PhD after graduation.

Professors:

- [Ainhoa Gonzalez Del Campo](https://people.ucd.ie/ainhoa.gonzalez): developing and applying geospatial analysis tools and methods for assessing environmental change and impacts, to better inform planning and decision-making;
- [Michela Bertolotto](https://people.ucd.ie/michela.bertolotto): spatio-temporal data modeling and mining, mobile and web-based GIS, map personalisation, open and crowd-sourced spatial data.



### Maynooth University (MU)

Maynooth, Ireland

Unit: [Department of Geography](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/geography)„ÄÅ[National Centre for Geocomputation](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/national-centre-geocomputation-ncg)

The University of Maynooth has a long history and is one of the four major national universities in Ireland, with significant international influence in computer science and geography. The Department of Geography at Maynooth is one of the largest in Europe, with research spanning human geography, physical geography, economic geography, landscape science, health geography, GIS and remote sensing. The National Centre for Geocomputing in Ireland was established by Stewart Fotheringham, author of the geographically weighted regression model, and the model's co-developers are all currently employed at the Centre. The Center focuses on the acquisition, storage, analysis and visualization of spatial data in the areas of geo-weighted regression models, health geomatics, urban analysis, satellite surveying, road infrastructure monitoring, and laser and drone data analysis applications.
