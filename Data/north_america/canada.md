### University of Calgary (U-Calgary)

Calgary, Alberta, Canada

Founded in 1945 as a branch of the University of Alberta, and then as an independent institution since 1966, the University of Calgary has a reputation for geological and mapping engineering, as well as research in petroleum science.

The Department of Geography at the University of Calgary offers graduate programs in geospatial science, including remote sensing, geoinformation, navigation, mapping, spatial statistics, and geographic data mining. This program also has collaborative programs with other programs in the same department (e.g., resource geography, social geography, geomorphology, glaciology, etc.). There are two types of graduate programs: project-based (including MA, MSc and PhD degrees) and lecture-based (MGIS degrees). The subject-based degree requires participation in scientific research and completion of a thesis, during which time courses closely related to the research content are required. The taught degree MGIS does not require research participation, but requires more advanced courses related to geomatics and remote sensing with more comprehensive coverage, which also takes 2 years to complete. In addition to the Department of Geography, the University's Department of Geomatics Engineering also has a GIS-related program.

The University of Calgary has a long and world-renowned history of surveying and mapping engineering, covering navigation, mobile surveying, GIS, and other fields. At present, the department is home to many famous scientists. The Department of Surveying and Mapping offers three graduate programs: a one-year taught master's degree, a thesis master's degree, and a PhD. The dissertation master's degree is usually completed in 2 years, and the PhD is completed in 3-4 years. The dissertation master's degree also has the opportunity to transfer to a PhD program.

### University of Guelph (Guelph)

Guelph, Ontario, Canada

The University of Guelph, located in Guelph, Ontario, Canada, is an outstanding comprehensive public university. The Department of Geography at the University of Guelph has degree programs in the MSc, MA and PhD pathways, with the MSc and PhD having a geomatics track. the MSc is a 2-year degree requiring participation in research and submission of a thesis, and the PhD is a 4-year degree requiring passing a qualifying exam and submission of a PhD thesis.

### York University (York)

Toronto, Ontario, Canada

York University, located in North York, Toronto, Ontario, is the third largest public university in Canada, with faculties such as the Schulich School of Business, Osgoode Hall Law School, and the Lassonde School of Engineering. York has three campuses, including the main campus in Keele, the Glendon campus, and the Markham Centre campus, which is currently under construction.

The Department of Geography at York has a wide range of geographic research areas, including technical and applied topics such as geoinformatics. Specifically, the Department of Geography Graduate School has two categories: the Master's program (MSc/MA) and the PhD program (PhD). The MSc program is a two-year program that requires a thesis or a first-authorship publication in an academic journal. The PhD program is 4 to 5 years long and in principle requires a master's degree in geography from a reputable university with a B+ overall performance in the master's program to be selected for the PhD program, but students who have a master's degree in another field with outstanding results may also have the opportunity to be selected. Students in the PhD program are required to take a qualifying exam in their second year, which is based on three of the major research areas of the Department of Geography, and which examines the depth and breadth of knowledge accumulated by the students. Students in the final PhD program are required to submit and defend their PhD thesis before graduation.
